# Spotify Playlist Updater

A utility that uses the [Spotify public API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to
move songs from a given playlist to a separate "archive" playlist.

The utility will use the [spotify-web-api-java-client](https://github.com/spotify-web-api-java/spotify-web-api-java)
to interact with the Spotify Web API more easily.
