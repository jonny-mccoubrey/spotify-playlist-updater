# Spotify Playlist Updater

## Overview
This project is a utility designed to move songs from one playlist to another after a specified number of days.

It interacts with the [Spotify public API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) through the 
[spotify-web-api-java client](https://github.com/spotify-web-api-java/spotify-web-api-java).

The utility can either be run from the commandline or as an AWS lambda function.
